C++ is a versatile, multi-paradigm programming language commonly referred to as a compiled language. In a typical C++ program, various source files are compiled by a compiler, producing object files. These object files are then combined by a linker to generate an executable program. The following figure illustrates the process of creating an executable file in C++:

In C++, there are two main types of entities:

1. **Core Language Features:** This includes built-in types, loops, conditional statements, and basic keywords that are fundamental to the language itself.
2. **Standard Library Components:** These are components from the Standard Template Library (STL), encompassing containers, algorithms, I/O operations, and essentially everything that is added using the `#include` directive to incorporate functionality from the standard library.

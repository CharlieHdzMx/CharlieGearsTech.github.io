# Introduction
Architecture should not be defined as taking into account the details of implementation, such as what type of database is used, the server that will be employed, or the specific communication protocols that may be utilized. Architecture is more about how the components of the software system are defined and being able to organize them in such a way that they do not cause significant problems in cohesion, coupling, and dependencies among them during the phases of development, deployment, operation change, and maintainability. 

The general purpose of architecture is to create a schema and structure for the software system to recognize the most essential and important elements while deferring decisions on less relevant details until later, when more information is available. By postponing those details, it is possible to have time and better resources to make more informed decisions regarding the finer details of the system.

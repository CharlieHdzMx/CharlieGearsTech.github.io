The cornerstone of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ is the **class**. This article offers a concise introduction to classes and their key features, including access specifiers, encapsulation, constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and copy assignment operators. Additionally, we explore related concepts such as cascading member functions and the explicit keyword.

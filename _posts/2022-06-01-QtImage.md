# Introduction

UndoImage is a software program that performs various image manipulations. Additionally, it utilizes the **Command Pattern** to undo and redo commands.

The Command Pattern encapsulates operations as objects with a common execution interface. This enables the positioning of operations in a queue, initiating saved operations, and undoing the results of a previously executed operation.

One of the Qt classes that can implement this pattern is **QUndoCommand**. QUndoCommand represents an action of dedicated operations and serves as the base class for all operations stored in a QUndoStack. QUndoCommand utilizes the functions undo() to undo operations and redo() to redo operations.

In UndoImage, six different image manipulators are employed, each of which publicly inherits from QUndoCommand:

* `AdjustColors`: For each RGBA pixel, the colors (Red, Green, and Blue) are adjusted based on user-specified values.

* `MirrorPixels`: Performs a pixel copy to simulate a mirror effect, either horizontally or vertically.

* `Monochrome`: Created by setting all three colors to the same value. However, to prevent the image from becoming overly dark, they are multiplied by different factors: Red *= 0.30, Green *= 0.59, and Blue *= 0.11. Subsequently, the three resulting values are added to obtain luminance, which is then set as the value for each color.

`Negative`: Converts the tricolor image to its negative. Each color value (v) is replaced by 255 - v.

`ScrambleColor`: For each pixel, permutes the values of the colors among themselves.

`TriColor`: For each pixel, compares its color intensity (average of its 3 colors), and depending on established hysteresis, reduces its colors to zero.

# Development
Each of the manipulators will inherit the `undo()` and `redo()` functions virtually, and they will add a specialized function for the operation. It's also important to store the image in a member variable to have a backup of the current image.

Among all manipulators, in all `undo()` functions, an assignment of the backup image to the current image will be performed. Meanwhile, the `redo()` function will execute the specialized operation, in this case, `adjust()`.

The parameters will come from spin boxes in the user interface window. Upon pressing a trigger button, the respective instance of QUndoCommand will be stored in the QUndoStack, and the window will be refreshed to display the changes.

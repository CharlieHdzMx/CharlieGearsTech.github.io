# Introduction

UndoImage is a software program that performs various image manipulations. Additionally, it utilizes the **Command Pattern** to undo and redo commands.

The Command Pattern encapsulates operations as objects with a common execution interface. This enables the positioning of operations in a queue, initiating saved operations, and undoing the results of a previously executed operation.

One of the Qt classes that can implement this pattern is **QUndoCommand**. QUndoCommand represents an action of dedicated operations and serves as the base class for all operations stored in a QUndoStack. QUndoCommand utilizes the functions undo() to undo operations and redo() to redo operations.

In UndoImage, six different image manipulators are employed, each of which publicly inherits from QUndoCommand:

`AdjustColors`: For each RGBA pixel, the colors (Red, Green, and Blue) are adjusted based on user-specified values.

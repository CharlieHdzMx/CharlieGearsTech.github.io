This article discusses the utilization of enum types as loop indexes, highlighting their value in expressing the desired iteration type without conflating conceptual types. Enum types serve to enhance code readability and maintainability by avoiding cumbersome casts and mitigating quality assurance warnings. 

Consider a scenario where a system comprises several power supplies. During the system initialization process, it becomes essential to inspect the states of all power supplies. Opting for an enum type proves superior to macros for iteration purposes. Therefore, a power supply enum type is created to facilitate this process.

```
  /*Available power supplies.*/
  typedef struct
  {
    PS_NORMAL = 0u,
    PS_AUX_1,
    PS_AUX_2,
    PS_GEN,
    PS_MAX
}HS_PowerSupply_Type;

/*Initialize the power supplies independently of their state.*/
void PowerSupply_Init(void)
{
  /*Expressing HS_PowerSupply_Type PS_LB to iterate.*/
  uint8 index = 0u;
  for(index = 0u; index < (uint8) PS_MAX; index ++)
  {
    PowerSupply_Restart((HS_PowerSupply_Type) index);
  }
  /*â€¦*/
}
```

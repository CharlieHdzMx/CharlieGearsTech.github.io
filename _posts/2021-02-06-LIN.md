**LIN** (Local Interconnected Network) is a serial automotive network protocol designed to establish a Local Network connection between devices at a lower cost compared to other networks like CAN (Controller Area Network), CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate), etc. Unlike more complex networks, LIN is not intended to be the primary network for the entire vehicle but serves as a complementary network for specific applications within the vehicle.

In the provided diagram, the red arrows represent CAN communication, while the green arrows represent LIN communication. Notably, the communication between the modules of the Seat Belt is exclusively through LIN. However, the communication between the Security Modules and the Seat Belt involves the use of CAN. This design choice is influenced by the fact that LIN does not offer the same bandwidth as CAN. Therefore, for data exchanges involving larger amounts of information, where LIN might be less suitable, CAN is employed to ensure efficient communication between the Seat Belt and other Security Modules.

The main properties of a LIN bus are:
1. One master for “**n**” slaves.
2. Similar low cost implementation of sillicon related to **UART/SCI** communication.
3. **Self sycnhronization** without the need of external clock in the slave nodes.
4. Deterministic signal transmision

LIN (Local Interconnected Network) is a serial automotive network protocol designed to establish a Local Network connection between devices at a lower cost compared to other networks like CAN (Controller Area Network), CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate), etc. Unlike more complex networks, LIN is not intended to be the primary network for the entire vehicle but serves as a complementary network for specific applications within the vehicle.

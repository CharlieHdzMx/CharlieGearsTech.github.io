# Introduction
In GNU environments, C++ compilation is based on a tool called **gcc**. Within gcc, there are sub-tools such as **g++**, which is responsible for taking source code files (.c and .h) and automatically linking them to the necessary C++ libraries. Using the g++ command line, you can apply the following command options:

1. **-Wall:** Enables additional warnings during the construction of objects that may be questionable but still conform to the C++ standard.
2. **-o <fileName>:** Specifies the name of the executable file. By default, if this option is not defined, gcc creates an output object named a.out.
3. **man g++ or info g++:** Provides manuals and detailed information about additional commands and options available in g++.

To execute the output object generated by g++, use the command **./a.out** in the terminal.

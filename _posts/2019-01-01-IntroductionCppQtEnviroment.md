# Introduction
In GNU environments, C++ compilation is based on a tool called **gcc**. Within gcc, there are sub-tools such as **g++**, which is responsible for taking source code files (.c and .h) and automatically linking them to the necessary C++ libraries. Using the g++ command line, you can apply the following command options:

1. **-Wall:** Enables additional warnings during the construction of objects that may be questionable but still conform to the C++ standard.
2. **-o <fileName>:** Specifies the name of the executable file. By default, if this option is not defined, gcc creates an output object named a.out.
3. **man g++ or info g++:** Provides manuals and detailed information about additional commands and options available in g++.

To execute the output object generated by g++, use the command **./a.out** in the terminal.

# Qmake
As in any project, in Qt it is necessary to have a tool that builds executables through the compilation of source code and linking of any dependencies. This requires a precise specification of inputs, intermediate tools based on use cases for building, and an output target specification. One of the most commonly used utilities for this is **make**. **Make** reads all the details of a project from a special file called a **makefile**, which contains:

1. **Rules** for building different types of files.
2. A list of all the **source files **and **headers** needed for the project.
3. The **target**, specifying which executable, library, or dependency will be built.
4. **Dependencies**, listing which executables need to be rebuilt when a specific file has been modified.

Qt includes a derivative of make called **qmake**, which is very similar to make but enables the definition of a **project file** (.pro) that is easier to use within the Qt environment and framework.

The HEADER section specifies whether the project is an APP, LIB, or SUBDIR:

1. For an **APP**, the output is an executable file.
2. For a **LIB**, the output is a library, based on the specified output configuration.
3. For a **SUBDIR**, it indicates that this is a parent .pro file, which will include sub-project .pro files with their own configurations.

## Include headers
Qmake recognizes headers when the project file includes an _INCLUDEPATH += dirName_ directive, allowing new headers or dependencies to be added to the project. Qt, like C++, supports three different ways of including a header in the source code:

1. _#include <iostream>_: This first searches for the header sequentially in the **"include path,"** where the C++ standard implementation is typically located.
2. _#include "headerName"_: This attempts to find a header with the name headerName in the i**nclude paths and HEADERS specified in the project file**.
3. _#include "seqPath/headerName"_: This searches first in the specified **seqPath** for a header with the name headerName.

When there is a name conflict with headerName, qmake uses the **first header it finds**. If it cannot locate any headerName, qmake will fail to produce a new executable and will return an **error for the project**.
